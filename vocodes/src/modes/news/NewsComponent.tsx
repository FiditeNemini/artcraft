        June 14, 2020: New website.
      </h2>

      <p>
        I'm creating models for a variety of speakers.
      </p>

      <h2>
        June 7, 2020: Website rewrite.
      </h2>

      <p>
        I rewrote the incredibly dated frontend in React and added help, news, and other
        information. The frontend won't be a huge concern for me going forward, but I'll
        periodically continue to make upgrades. One critical feature I intend to add is the 
        ability to download audio files and replay them.
      </p>

      <h2>
        June 4, 2020: There's a new model.
      </h2>

      <p>
        I replaced the old model with a completely new one that doesn't crash and is a 
        10x speed up over the last one. While it doesn't currently sound as good as the 
        old model, the performance improvements were good enough to warrant using it 
        immediately. I'll make it sound better soon. So many things in the pipeline...
      </p>

      <h2>May 30, 2020: Intermittent failure.</h2> 

      <p>
        There's now another issue with how models are distributed to the workers. I have 
        a solution in the works and expect it to be in place before morning tomorrow.
      </p>

      <h2>
        May 25, 2020: I'm actively working on development.
      </h2>

      <p>
        This site has been sitting in limbo for four years. It used to use concatenative
        TTS, but now uses Tacotron. I've been working on ML for the past year, but haven't
        taken the time to update this website.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I've got an improved model in the works, and I'm focused on scaling the cluster.
        There's an occasional server crash bug I'm chasing down (right now the server 
        instances respawn when they die). The frontend will be updated soon to no longer
        cache results.
