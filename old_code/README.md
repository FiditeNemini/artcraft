Old code repositories merged in for reference
=============================================

Starting with the new monorepo, storyteller-web, I merged in old (related) code, 
so that I can resurrect some of it. 

Following these instructions: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14470212

### Repositories

- `cloudcam-green-screen`: cloudcam w/ working green screen GUI
- `cloudcam-unreal-zeromq`: cloudcam w/ ZeroMQ protocol that talks to Unreal Engine "CloudCamPlugin"
- `realtime-voice-conversion`: realtime-voice-conversion (cyclegan, protos, rust+python sidecar)
- `trumpet-trumped.com`: old `trumped.com` (trumpet) codebase. This has useful phoneme and ordinal code
- `voder-vocodes-1.0`: old voder (vocodes 1.0, I think)
