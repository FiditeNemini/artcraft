discord-vocodes
===============
A discord bot for vocodes.

## Install
Needs `libssl-dev`, `libsodium-dev` and other packages the 
[serenity package README](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) mentions and
the [special docs](https://wombat.platymuus.com/rustdoc/discord_master/) of the
original library.

At least I assume `serenity` is a better fork of `discord`. It's got a lot more
going for it.
