///
/// Note on usage: since this is a generic function with only one generic type, `P`, you can only pass
/// a list of paths that are all the same type. If you have a mix of `PathBuf` and `&Path`, it's best to
/// convert the PathBuf to &Path references. Mixing other `AsRef<Path>` types will be more complicated,
/// so it may be worth calling `as_ref()` on them, e.g.:
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};
/// use filesys::file_deletion::safe_delete_all_files_and_directories::safe_delete_all_files_and_directories;
///
/// safe_delete_all_files_and_directories(&[
///   Path::new("1234_foo_bar_baz.bash"),
///   &PathBuf::from("1234_foo_bar_baz.bin"),
/// ]);
