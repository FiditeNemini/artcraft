// implemented. Perhaps this will improve in the future, but for now manually constructed queries
// cannot have type hints, eg. the following:
//
//    m.token as `token: tokens::tokens::media_files::MediaFileToken`,
//    m.origin_category as `origin_category: enums::by_table::media_files::media_file_origin_category::MediaFileOriginCategory`,
//    m.creator_set_visibility as `creator_set_visibility: enums::common::visibility::Visibility`,
//
// This results in the automatic mapping not being able to be found by name (for macro derive), and
// in the manual case `row.try_get()` etc. won't have the correct column name (since the name is the
// full "as" clause).
