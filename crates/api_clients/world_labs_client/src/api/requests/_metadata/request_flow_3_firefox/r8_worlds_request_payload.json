      "text_prompt": "The scene is a cozy A-frame cabin interior, rendered in a realistic style, exuding warmth and rustic charm, creating a tranquil and inviting atmosphere. A prominent wooden A-frame structure defines the architecture, featuring angled timber beams that converge towards the peak of the ceiling. The walls and ceiling are paneled with warm-toned wooden planks, creating a consistent and enveloping aesthetic throughout the space. A large, floor-to-ceiling window dominates one wall, offering an expansive view of a lush forest with tall trees and autumnal foliage outside, suggesting the cabin is nestled deep within nature. A plush bed occupies a significant portion of the floor space, adorned with a dark grey duvet, numerous pillows, and a rust-colored throw blanket, inviting comfort and relaxation. A cream-colored faux fur rug rests on the wooden floor beside the bed, adding texture and a soft landing. A black wood-burning stove with a visible fire provides heat and a focal point for the room, situated near the large window. The floor is made of polished light wood planks. On the other side of the cabin, a continuation of the wooden paneling and A-frame structure mirrors the visible portion, maintaining architectural consistency. Another large window, identical in style and size to the visible one, would likely offer a similar forest view on the opposite side of the cabin, bathing the entire space in natural light filtered through the trees. A small, rustic armchair with a woven texture would be positioned near the stove on the opposite side, providing an additional seating area for enjoying the warmth. A stack of neatly chopped firewood is arranged next to the stove, ready for use, emphasizing the cabin's rustic functionality. "
