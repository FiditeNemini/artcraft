//! kube-pod-cleanup
//!
//! Rationale: In production, dead/evicted pods stick around for eternity.
//! Within a matter of days, thousands of dead pods can clutter the output of `kubectl`,
//! making it operationally difficult to maintain the cluster.
//!
//! This tool quickly dispenses of garbage pods. (Though we may still want to keep them
//! for debugging actual issues.)
//!
//! To install as a system binary, do the following:
//!
//!  cargo install --path ./crates/cli/kubectl_pod_cleanup --bin kubectl-pod-cleanup
//!
//! (Cargo install seems to currently require the --path argument in a workspace,
//! as tracked by this issue: https://stackoverflow.com/a/76271890 )
//!
