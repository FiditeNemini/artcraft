ArtCraft
========
ArtCraft is the IDE for interactive AI image and video creation.
We turn prompting into *crafting*, so your ideas become a form of tangible expression and computing.
This is Adobe Photoshop for everyone, and we're giving away the source code!

## Advanced Crafting Features
Text-to-image is great, but artists *need control*. It's important to know what your image will look like before you generate it, and it's vitally important to achieve consistency and repeatability.

| Feature                         | Demo + Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Image to Location**           | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21f103e3-cc19-4882-a630-9caa1b76ae31) Placing virtual actors into physical environments establishes single-location consistency. You can film multiple shots within a room without having things disappear.         |
| **3D Image Compositing**        | ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f93a616f-571d-474e-bcc0-53736de7303d) Use images (backdrops, foreground elements, props, etc.) in scenes with depth and blend them naturally together. Just a couple of images usually leads to great compositions. |
| **2D Image Compositing**        | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6f99391-e496-4c62-9e37-29734ba5f899) Use images, background removal, layers, and simple drawing tools to precisely compose a scene.                                                                                |
| **Image to 3D Mesh**            | ![Video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/600a405c-e360-48c1-9b42-6e657ae6243b) It's almost impossible to lay out complicated objects or block complicated scenes; turning images into 3D helps position elements exactingly and intentionally.               |
| **Mixed Asset Crafting**        | ![Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/storytold/github-media/main/ship-editing.gif) You can use image cutouts, worlds, and simple 3D meshes all together to precisely and intentionally lay out your scenes.                                                       |
| **Character Posing**            | ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52a8e983-7c8f-42d2-be8b-25296ab9ed57) You can dynamically pose your characters to achieve the precise character, scene, and camera blocking before calling "action".                                                |

## Quick and Easy Prompting
We haven't abandoned text-to-asset generation for quick prototyping and ideation. We support every popular workflow in a first class fashion.

We're going to be adding the following providers soon: Kling (via Kling website accounts), Google (via API keys), 
Runway (via website account), Luma (via website account).

We're potentially interested in adding other aggregators for those who already have subscriptions and credits at 
those providers, for example: OpenArt, FreePik, etc.
