  -- ========== INFERENCE DETAILS ==========

  -- There is an index on this column.
  -- The new enum for the type of job, which will eventually replace `inference_category` and `maybe_model_type`.
  -- This isn't fully supported yet in the inference-job, but we'll start populating it and adding logic around it.
  -- We'll start this out as nullable, then migrate the old rows with a default column value.
  job_type VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- There is an index on this column.
  -- This is a user-facing and analytics-facing column that describes what product area the job
  -- is attributed to. For example, this will help us separate "video style transfer" from
  -- "storyteller studio" and also separate "live portrait" from "webcam live portrait".
  product_category VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- There is an index on this column.
  -- NB: This is becoming a problematic field and is becoming conflated with `maybe_model_type`.
  -- We're using this to handle job dispatching, but the latter is being used to load container
  -- dependencies at startup (even if it isn't a real model type or a polymorphic foreign key).
  -- This is pretty gross and horrible.
  --
  -- Broad category of inference
  -- Examples (may not be up to date):
  --  * text_to_speech
  --  * voice_conversion
  inference_category VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,

  -- There is an index on this column.
  -- NB: See notes on inference_category. This is becoming a problematic field. We're using
  -- this to load the container spin-up arguments and dependencies, but the former is being
  -- used to dispatch the job. `inference_category` is the one that should probably go away,
  -- and this column should be renamed to `inference_job_type`.
  --
  -- Potential part of the composite foreign key to the primary model being used, if any.
  -- This will normally live in `maybe_inference_args`, but in this case, it's useful for
  -- running easy database analytical queries.
  --
  -- Examples (may not be up to date):
  --    * rvc_v2
  --    * so_vits_svc
  --    * tacotron2
  --    * vits
  maybe_model_type VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- running easy database analytical queries.
  maybe_model_token VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- If the inference job takes some other kind of entity, this will be the token
  -- Not all inference jobs have record-like input sources.
  maybe_input_source_token VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- If the inference job takes some other kind of entity, this will be the type of the
  -- token. For now, this is just `media_upload`.
  -- Not all inference jobs have record-like input sources.
  maybe_input_source_token_type VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- Polymorphic arguments payload that depends on the type of inference job.
  -- TEXT = 65,535 bytes (64 KiB), ~= 4 bytes per UTF-8 character, ~ 16383 characters.
  maybe_inference_args TEXT DEFAULT NULL,

  -- For text-based workloads, the raw, unprocessed user input.
  -- TEXT = 65,535 bytes (64 KiB), ~= 4 bytes per UTF-8 character, ~ 16383 characters.
  maybe_raw_inference_text TEXT DEFAULT NULL,

  -- For download-related jobs, this is the URL
  -- This is nullable because not all inference jobs have a download URL.
  -- The length of 1024 is arbitrary, but we shouldn't need anything longer.
  maybe_download_url VARCHAR(1024) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- For download-related jobs, this is the cover image to set.
  -- This is nullable because not all inference jobs have a download URL.
  -- And furthermore, not all download URLs have a cover image.
  maybe_cover_image_media_file_token VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- ========== SUCCESS CASE ==========

  -- The type of the object will vary based on the type of the upload,
  -- and we may include heuristics that auto-detect types in the future
  on_success_result_entity_type VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- If the job completes successfully, this is the result token.
  -- This is only populated on a successful result.
  on_success_result_entity_token VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- If the job completes successfully, this is the batch token (ie. when
  -- several results are created).
  -- Only populated if there are actual batches generated.
  on_success_result_batch_token VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- ========== CREATOR DETAILS AND PREFERENCES ==========

  -- Foreign key to user
  maybe_creator_user_token VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- Based on a cookie sent by the frontend.
  -- We'll save this even if the user is logged in.
  maybe_creator_anonymous_visitor_token VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- For abuse tracking.
  -- Wide enough for IPv4/6
  creator_ip_address VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,

  -- The creator can set a desired visibility for their data.
  -- This does not always apply to every upload type.
  -- Additionally, some upload types may require moderator approval prior
  -- to being publicly listed, and this field has no bearing on that.
  -- NB: DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE ENUM VALUES DURING SCHEMA MIGRATIONS.
  creator_set_visibility ENUM(
    'public',
    'hidden',
    'private'

  -- ========== PREMIUM FEATURES METADATA ==========

  -- The maximum duration for generated audio or video in seconds.
  -- Zero is implied to be the default value, which is typically 12 seconds.
  -- A negative value implies "unlimited".
  max_duration_seconds INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,

  -- ========== WORKLOAD SOURCE AND PRIORITY ==========

  -- Priority *increases*, so a level of 2 will be higher than 1.
  -- These are the level semantics currently:
  --   - All jobs from anonymous FakeYou users have level 0.
  --   - All jobs from logged in FakeYou users have level 1.
  --   - All jobs from Twitch TTS (unpaid) have level 10 (ten).
  --   - (There will be future levels for paid Twitch and social FakeYou rewards.)
  priority_level SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,

  -- For non-premium workloads (or some other workloads), we may require that the
  -- user remains on the website. This will help us kill jobs if the user leaves.
  -- The state for this keepalive signal will be job-type dependent and may live
  -- in Redis or some other system. Typically the frontend job status polling will
  -- populate this keepalive signal (eg. in a Redis key with TTL).
  is_keepalive_required BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,

  -- TODO: add is_for_storyteller_product
  is_from_premium_user BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  is_from_api_user BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  is_for_twitch BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,

  -- ========== DEVELOPMENT AND DEBUGGING METADATA ==========

  -- If true, the request gets a "debug" flag, which may do different
  -- things depending on the type of work. This doesn't really have any
  -- specific meaning -- it can be used to flag for anything -- but should
  -- typically be used for one-off debugging and not a part of the normal
  -- product surface area. Contrast this with `maybe_routing_tag`, which
  -- forces the job onto a specific physical server: this might be a flag
  -- deployed to handle debugging across the entire fleet.
  is_debug_request BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,

  -- If set, the request gets processed by a special "tagged" worker
  -- that matches this tag. The ordinary workers will ignore this work.
  -- The tag is typically added via a special HTTP header when the work
  -- is enqueued. In practice, this means we can canary deploy or cordon
  -- off special workers to handle certain jobs.
  maybe_routing_tag VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- ========== JOB SYSTEM DETAILS ==========

  -- Jobs begin as "pending", then transition to other states.
  --
  --  * Pending = job is ready to go
  --  * Started = job is running
  --  * Complete_Success = job is done (success)
  --  * Complete_Failure = job is done (permanent failure, eg. a Face Animator job without a face)
  --  * Attempt_Failed = job failed but may retry.
  --  * Dead = job failed permanently (ie. exhausted retries)
  --  * Cancelled_By_User = the user canceled their own job
  --  * Cancelled_By_System = the system terminated the job (ie. load shedding, user account deletion, etc.)
  --
  -- Pending -> Started -> Complete_Success
  --                    |-> Complete_Failure

  -- We can track this against a "max_attempt_count"
  attempt_count SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,

  -- If the user chooses to no longer display or poll the job, we mark this flag true.
  -- This should only be set for terminal state (completed or failed) jobs.
  -- We use this flag to remove the job from the user's view.
  is_dismissed_by_user BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,

  -- If there is a failure, tell the user why.
  -- This isn't localized or very friendly to present to the user.
  failure_reason VARCHAR(512) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- Optional internal-only debugging information in the case of failure.
  internal_debugging_failure_reason VARCHAR(512) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- An enum-like key to present the frontend with a failure class in an
  -- i18n-friendly way. The javascript/frontend can use these as indices
  -- into descriptive, broadly-localized error messages.
  --
  --   * 'face_not_detected' for images or videos that do not have a detectable
  --                         face (SadTalker, Wav2Lip, etc.)
  --
  --   * 'keep_alive_elapsed' when users walk away from their inference job and
  --                          the workload class expects for them to remain
  --
  --   * 'not_yet_implemented' error for developers during feature development
  --                           and prototyping. Should ideally never happen in
  --                           production
  --
  --   * 'retryable_worker_error' for generic worker errors (full filesystem,
  --                              etc.) that can be retried. (We don't need to
  --                              tell the user why the job failed.)
  --
  frontend_failure_category VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- On success, we populate how long the job execution took in milliseconds.
  -- We have this because 1) the job system timestamps are second-resolution,
  -- and 2) the structure of the jobs executor may change, potentially changing
  -- derived execution time analytics with it.
