  -- example of the model. Like album art or a user profile picture / avatar.

  -- `[{maybe_public_bucket_prefix}]{public_bucket_hash}[{maybe_public_bucket_extension}]`
  maybe_public_bucket_prefix VARCHAR(16) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- An optional appended extension on the bucket filename.
  -- If present, this will be appended to the end of the bucket filename to access the file.
  -- To allow for flexibility, this extension typically will contain a leading period if
  -- the file needs it (eg ".mp4" rather than "mp4")!
  -- The bucket filename for the primary file (not including the directory path) is given by:
  -- `[{maybe_public_bucket_prefix}]{public_bucket_hash}[{maybe_public_bucket_extension}]`

  -- ========== MODERATION DETAILS ==========

  -- Mods may have to approve of vc models for them to show up in a public index.
  -- Models can be used by the author (or other parties that know the URL) before
  -- they're approved, but unapproved models won't show up in public indices.
