  -- ========== OTHER INFO ==========

  -- The user's email address. Provided only if you included the email scope in your request.
  -- The value of this claim may not be unique to this account and could change over time,
  -- therefore you should not use this value as the primary identifier to link to your user record.
  -- You also can't rely on the domain of the email claim to identify users of Google Workspace or
  -- Cloud organizations; use the hd claim instead.
  --
  -- NB: If this is null, we'll simply deny the sign in / sign up event. So effectively, our copy
  -- will never be null.
