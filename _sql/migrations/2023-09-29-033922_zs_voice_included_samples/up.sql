-- In order to rebuild any "zs_voice", we need to know which dataset samples were included.
-- Since users can change the dataset at any time after a voice was originally created, these
-- records are generated to retain a record of which samples fed into a given voice.
-- These records will probably not be used for any product features, just as a means to study
-- poor-performing voices, perform migrations, etc.
