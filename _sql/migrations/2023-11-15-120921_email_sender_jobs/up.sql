  token VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,

  -- Idempotency token from client
  -- This is so we don't submit duplicate jobs.
  uuid_idempotency_token VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,

  -- ========== EMAIL TYPE AND ARGS ==========

  -- Type of email (and the template) to use.
  -- This is the most important part of the email job.
  -- Possible values:
  --  * password_reset
  --  * welcome
  email_category VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,

  -- Polymorphic arguments payload that depends on the type of email job.
  -- TEXT = 65,535 bytes (64 KiB), ~= 4 bytes per UTF-8 character, ~ 16383 characters.

  -- ========== EMAIL DESTINATION ==========

  -- Email we're sending to (always authoritative over the user token
  -- record, even if user token is set)
  destination_email_address VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- Maybe the user record this is being sent to.
  maybe_destination_user_token  VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- ========== EMAIL LANGUAGE ==========

  -- Email the language should be sent in.
  -- The full IETF BCP47 language tag (eg. en, en-US, es-419, ja-JP, pt, etc.)
  -- The wide varchar space is because these language tags can become cumbersome, eg "hy-Latn-IT-arevela"
  ietf_language_tag VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'en',

  -- Email the language should be sent in.
  -- The IETF BCP47 language tag's primary language subtag (eg. "es-419" becomes "es" and "en-US" becomes "en")
  ietf_primary_language_subtag VARCHAR(12) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'en',

  -- ========== CREATOR DETAILS ==========

  -- Foreign key to user that triggered the job (eg. for user DMs)
  maybe_creator_user_token VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- AVT of the user that triggered the job (eg. for user DMs)
  -- Based on a cookie sent by the frontend.

  -- ========== WORKLOAD SOURCE AND PRIORITY ==========

  -- Priority *increases*, so a level of 2 will be higher than 1.

  --   - (N/A; all emails should be roughly the same importance for now)
  priority_level SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,

  -- ========== DEVELOPMENT AND DEBUGGING METADATA ==========

  -- If true, the request gets a "debug" flag, which may do different
  -- things depending on the type of work. This doesn't really have any
  -- specific meaning -- it can be used to flag for anything -- but should
  -- typically be used for one-off debugging and not a part of the normal
  -- product surface area. Contrast this with `maybe_routing_tag`, which
  -- forces the job onto a specific physical server: this might be a flag
  -- deployed to handle debugging across the entire fleet.
  is_debug_request BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,

  -- If set, the request gets processed by a special "tagged" worker
  -- that matches this tag. The ordinary workers will ignore this work.
  -- The tag is typically added via a special HTTP header when the work
  -- is enqueued. In practice, this means we can canary deploy or cordon
  -- off special workers to handle certain jobs.
  maybe_routing_tag VARCHAR(32) DEFAULT NULL,

  -- ========== JOB SYSTEM DETAILS ==========

  -- Jobs begin as "pending", then transition to other states.
  --
  --  * Pending = job is ready to go
  --  * Started = job is running
  --  * Complete_Success = job is done (success)
  --  * Complete_Failure = job is done (permanent failure, eg. a Face Animator job without a face)
  --  * Attempt_Failed = job failed but may retry.
  --  * Dead = job failed permanently (ie. exhausted retries)
  --  * Cancelled_By_User = the user canceled their own job
  --  * Cancelled_By_System = the system terminated the job (ie. load shedding, user account deletion, etc.)
  --
  -- Pending -> Started -> Complete_Success
  --                    |-> Complete_Failure
