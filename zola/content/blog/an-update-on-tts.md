In FakeYou.com, users can use Text To Speech (TTS) AI in order to create well-known voices from their favorite media instantly. As of a recent update, new voice models have received an upgrade and the website has been overhauled, which will allow you to generate higher quality voices even easier!

# How to get started:

1. Go to https://fakeyou.com/tts
2. Choose from the **Featured Voices** or search for a voice of your own.
3. Voices with the **New** tag will be using the newer model for generating.
4. Enter your text and Speak! Your output will be received shortly.

Make sure to check out other functions such as Voice to Voice conversion (V2V) or Video Style Transfer which have improved in recent updates too.
