# Negative Prompting Guide
Negative prompting helps remove unwanted elements in your images. To use it, go to the 'AI Stylize' tab, find 'Negative Prompt' and click to expand the panel.

For example, if your character has green hair and you don't want it, enter '(green hair:1.5)' in the negative prompt field. Parentheses emphasize the words, and ':1.5' indicates how strongly to focus on it. A good range is 1.1-1.5. You can also use extra parentheses for emphasis, like '(((green hair)))’.

Here’s an example video of before and after a negative prompt was used. As you can see, -unwanted element- was removed from the generation.
