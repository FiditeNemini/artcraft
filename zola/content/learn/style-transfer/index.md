# Style Transfer

Sometimes, it's hard to get the details right as you envision them. That's where Style Reference comes in. If you have an image you'd like to use as a reference, whether it's scenery, a subject, or a certain art style, Style Transfer will handle it. It also increases consistency, decreasing pop-ins or morphing.

To use Style Transfer, go to the "Stylize" tab. Drag and drop an image into the panel where prompted, or click to upload one. Crop the image as desired.

After entering your image, you don't need to add the qualities of the image to the prompt, as they'll automatically be handled. You can also choose not to prompt at all if you want it to solely focus on the image you inputted. Once you're satisfied, press "Generate Movie."

Here’s an example of before and after style transfer:
