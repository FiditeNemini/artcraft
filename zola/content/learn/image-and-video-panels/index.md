# Image and Video Panels
Image and Video Panels allow you to import your own images and videos into the studio for 3d manipulation. To access them, go to the “Image & Video Panels” tab on the right hand side of the studio and select either “Image Panels” or “Video Panels” and click “Upload”. 

Once you’ve uploaded your selected media, click on it and drag it onto the scene. You can click to select it and press either T, R or G to adjust position, rotation or scale. Alternatively, you can use the transform panel on the right hand side to adjust it as well. 

You can combine multiple image and video panels to create interesting outputs. 
Here’s an example of a video generated using video panels and one with image panels:
