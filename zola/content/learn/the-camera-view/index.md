# The Camera View

## Entering Camera View
To enter Camera View, go to the bottom left pane above the "Timeline" panel and click "Enter View." Once in this view, use WASD to move the camera and the middle mouse button to orbit. When you're done, click "Exit View."

## Creating Camera Transitions
To create a camera transition, first select the camera. In the bottom right corner above the Timeline panel, you’ll find the transformation panel. To start a transition, go to the desired start time and press "Add Keyframe." Then move to the end time on the timeline, position the camera where you want the transition to end, and press "Add Keyframe" again. This creates a moving camera transition.

## Alternate Ways to Move the Camera
You can also move the camera by selecting it as an object and pressing T (Move), R (Rotate), or G (Scale). Alternatively, you can move the camera using the transformation panel.
