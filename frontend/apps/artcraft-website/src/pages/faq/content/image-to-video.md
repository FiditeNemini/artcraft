## From still to motion in minutes

Image to Video converts any image—your Text to Image result or a photo—into a short clip. Choose a video model, set duration and motion, then add a concise prompt to guide style and mood.

## Best practices

- Start from a clean, well‑lit image with a readable subject.
- Keep motion subtle for realism: camera drift, gentle parallax, or small pose changes.
- Use consistent prompts if you create a series of clips.

## Workflow

1. Pick a video model and duration.
2. Adjust motion options (camera, subject, or both).
3. Add a brief prompt for style and atmosphere.
4. Render, review, and export.
