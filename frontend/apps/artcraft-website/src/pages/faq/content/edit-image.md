## Precise edits without leaving ArtCraft

Edit Image lets you remove objects, fix details, or restyle parts of an image. Paint a mask, write a brief instruction, and generate. Only the masked region changes; the rest stays locked.

## Common uses

- Clean plates: remove cables, signage, or passers‑by.
- Product swaps: change colorways, logos, or materials.
- Portrait touch‑ups: hairline fixes, reflections, and lighting tweaks.

## Tips

- Keep masks tight around the area you want to change.
- Use short, clear instructions (e.g., “replace with polished chrome”).
- For multi‑step edits, work from big to small changes.
