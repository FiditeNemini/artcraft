## Compose scenes like a playable set

The 3D Editor lets you place subjects, cameras, and lights in a real‑time scene. Add objects and characters, pose characters, and orbit the camera until the shot feels right. When you generate, the AI keeps your framing and pose intact.

## Why 3D matters

- Consistency across multiple shots and angles.
- Natural camera motion and depth cues.
- Character posing that matches your vision.

## Workflow

1. Choose a preset from ArtCraft presets by clicking the + button above or import images to build the scene.
2. Place the subject, set the camera height and focal length.
3. Add a concise prompt for style and materials.
4. Generate, compare, and tweak until it clicks.
