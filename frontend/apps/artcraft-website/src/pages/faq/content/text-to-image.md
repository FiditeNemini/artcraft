## Turn prompts into polished images

Text to Image in ArtCraft lets you move quickly from idea to result. Choose a model, write a clear prompt, and render. If you need more control, sketch a loose layout on the 2D canvas or block a scene in 3D first—generation will respect your composition.

## Tips for great prompts

- Be specific about subject, action, and style (lighting, lens, materials).
- Prefer short, descriptive phrases over long paragraphs.
- Use negative cues sparingly (e.g., “no text, no watermark”).

## Choose the right model

Different models excel at different looks. For photorealism, use a high‑fidelity model. For design and branding, choose a model that handles flat color and typography well. If speed matters, start with a fast model to explore options, then switch to a higher‑quality model for final renders.

## Iterate with structure

If the result is close but not perfect, keep the composition and re‑render small regions with inpainting. This preserves the framing while fixing details like hands, logos, or textures.
