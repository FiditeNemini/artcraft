# Characters & Animations
There are two types of characters and animations: anime and cartoon. You can't mix their animation types. You can upload your own Cartoon characters as long as they’re of Mixamo rigging. 

Anime characters include those from Hololive, Wuthering Waves, Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, and Punishing Grey Raven, as well as popular MMD dances and a variety of basic animations. You can upload your own MMD motions.

To use a character, go to either the Cartoon or Anime characters list, click on a character and drag them onto the scene. To add an animation, go to the "Animations" tab, drag the animation onto the timeline, and position it at the start. Extend it by dragging the right corner. You can add multiple animations to one character.

To move a character from their original position, select the character, adjust their starting position, and press "Add Keyframe" on the transform panel. Repeat this for the ending position.
