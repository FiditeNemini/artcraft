## Draw first, generate second

The 2D Canvas is a lightweight drawing and layout tool that the model respects. Sketch shapes, block the background, and mask areas to protect or change. When you generate, the structure you drew stays intact—only the fidelity improves.

## What it’s great for

- Storyboards, thumbnails, product mockups.
- Replacing elements in a scene without moving the rest.
- Fast “idea to image” iterations.

## Tips

- Use high‑contrast sketches for clearer guidance.
- Mask small areas for better local edits (logos, eyes, hands, reflections).
- Keep prompts short; the canvas already supplies structure.
