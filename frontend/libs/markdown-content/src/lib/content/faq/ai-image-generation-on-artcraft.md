## What is AI image generation in ArtCraft?

ArtCraft brings modern AI image generation into a creator-first workflow that runs locally. You compose your idea on a 2D canvas or in a 3D scene, then guide the model to render the final image with consistency and control. The result is a fast loop for exploration, iteration, and polished outputs.

## Core capabilities

- 2D Canvas guidance: sketch layouts, place references, mask areas, and refine with inpainting.
- 3D Scene composition: set camera, lighting, and subject placement for consistent multi-shot renders.
- Structure-preserving generation: keep the arrangement you designed while improving detail and lighting.
- Revisions that respect intent: re-run specific regions to fix details without losing the overall look.

## A simple workflow

- Plan the shot: define focal point, subject scale, angle, and background (2D) or block out a scene (3D).
- Add guidance: references, masks, or prompts that clarify style, mood, and key details.
- Generate and iterate: compare candidates, refine regions, and lock in the final composition.

## Quality and consistency tips

- Favor clear subjects and readable silhouettes; the model follows strong structure best.
- Use concise prompts; describe style, lighting, and subject specifics with minimal filler.
- For multi-image sets, keep camera, distance, and lighting consistent between shots.
- Iterate locally on regions that need corrections (eyes, hands, logos, or textures).

## Responsible use

Only generate content you have the rights to create. Avoid infringing on other artists’ styles or producing deceptive media. When sharing, be transparent about AI involvement and follow relevant community and platform guidelines.
