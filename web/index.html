        <h2>Terms and Conditions.</h2>

        <strong>Don't use this website for mischief.</strong>

        <p>Please have fun with this app amongst your friends and colleages, but don't
        do anything stupid. The actions you take are your own, and I am not responsible
        for any trouble you might get into. Use your best judgment. For example, though
        you might find it funny, please don't use this app to harass the poor people
        working at Gamestop. They don't have Battle Toads.</p>

        <strong>Artistic Intent.</strong>

        <p>This website is a form of artistic expression and engineering creativity and is
        not meant to be harmful to anyone in any way. The audio generated is sufficiently
        poor in quality and should not be confused with actual speech. Everyone should be
        able to have a good laugh at the program (and how poorly I've implemented a text
        to speech algorithm).</p>

        <h3>Actual questions I haven't been asked by anyone ever.</h3>

        <strong>"Jungle Horse"?</strong>
        <p>Yes.</p>

        <strong>What about Hillary?</strong>
        <p>The original version of Jungle Horse supported Hillary, but I simply have
        not had enough time to feature both presidential candidates. It takes a lot
        of effort to to gather and curate all of the required samples to power a TTS
        engine, and as you might imagine from the <em>amazing quality</em>
        of Jungle Horse-generated audio. Factor in the engineering work required
        and bam... negative hours in my schedule remain.</p>

        <strong>Why is this so late into the election?</strong>
        <p>I spent too many weekends having wild parties (such lies ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)).</p>

        <strong>How did you make this?</strong>
        <p>I spent several weekends typing various letters, numbers, and characters
        like "=" and "}" on my laptop keyboard.</p>

        <p>For a more direct answer&mdash;people I know will groan at my
        evangelism&mdash;I wrote this mostly in Rust, a systems programming language
        I've completely fallen in love with. If you're an engineer, you should give it
        a try. Rust makes a great addition to any toolbox.</p>

        <p>For any kids and students considering a future in software engineering, you
        should know that programming lets you do absolutely magical things on a daily
        basis. It also makes an excellent career.</p>

        <h3>Donations Welcome!</h3>

        <strong>Future projects and stuff.</strong>

        <p>I have so many ideas for projects! Tetris projected onto the Georiga
        Pacific skyscraper, an interactive time travel film with hundreds of branching
        plotlines, a video game with a blind protagonist rendered entirely with audio...</p>

        <p>I spend my own time and money on making stuff, but if you enjoyed this, it'd be
        awesome to get something back. No worries if not. I'm happy just knowing I made
        somebody (you...?) laugh or smile.</p>

        <strong>Collaborations</strong>

        <p>If you're an Atlanta-area artist or hacker, you should totally meet me for coffee
        at Krog St. Market someday. My only hobby outside of listening to terrible hipster
        music is that I like to make stuff. Working solo is fun, but collaborators might be
        neat too. (Word of warning: while I'm not a vampire, I may or may not be a night owl.)</p>

        <p>So does anybody want to hack on a late start into the November
        <a href="https://github.com/blog/2274-game-off-theme-announcement">Github Game Jam</a>?
        (And can we write it in Rust?)</p>
