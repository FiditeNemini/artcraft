ArtCraft Roadmap
================

## 2026 Goals (non-exhaustive)

- Make ArtCraft better and more useful than model aggregation websites (our #1 goal).
  We don't dislike those websites; we just set a high standard for ourselves.

- Build the best "tangible" computing surfaces where you can mold scenes and videos like 
  clay and direct them with precision and clarity.

- Add every model and provider into ArtCraft so you can build your own crafting IDE. 
  Nothing will be left out.

- Build purpose-specific image models, eg. for relighting scenes and reposing characters
  and props.

- Build our content studio. Make lots of narrative shorts and at least one 
  feature-length AI film in 2026. Theatrical distribution, but also lots of social 
  media content. (We are creators, and we want to employ more creators!)

- Architecture: remove dependence on ArtCraft hosted services.

- Architecture: more Rust, more speed.
 
- Community: build a safe community free of "anti-AI" trolls. A community of AI filmmakers 
  and creators

## Loftier Goals

- Build an *Open* OpenAI / Google / Anthropic. Open models, open platforms, open hardware.
  Why? Because the future could be bleak without it. How, you might ask? Get in touch if 
  you're curious.

- Don't Be Evil (tm)
