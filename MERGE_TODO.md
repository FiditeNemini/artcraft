Instructions for merging repos
==============================

Following https://stackoverflow.com/a/14470212

Status:


- `old_a`: storyteller-web (FakeYou, Storyteller)
- `old_b`: cloudcam w/ working green screen GUI
- `old_c`: cloudcam w/ ZeroMQ protocol that talks to Unreal Engine "CloudCamPlugin"
- `old_d`: old voder (vocodes 1.0, I think)
- `old_e`: realtime-voice-conversion (cyclegan, protos, rust+python sidecar)

TODO: 

- Merge in realtime voice conversion
- Merge in old 'voder'
