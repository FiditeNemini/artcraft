ArtCraft License (WIP)
======================

(**Warning**: This isn't a real lawyery license full of legitimate legalese yet, but we'll take care of that ASAP.)

ArtCraft is a form of "fair source" software. It's like [free beer](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free_as_in_beer) 
in that we give you the code, but there are a few small limitations on what you can do with it.

First, what you *can* do with ArtCraft:

>  1. You do not have to pay us to use ArtCraft. It's free.
> 
>  2. You can back up, copy, modify, compile, and use the code for your own private personal purposes.
>  
>  3. You can do anything you want with the media you create with ArtCraft. Generated assets are yours.

What you *can't do* with ArtCraft:

> 1. You cannot sell the ArtCraft software commercially (eg. as your own software).
>  
> 2. You cannot use the ArtCraft code to develop a competing business or product (eg. selling AI image and video tools).
>
> 3. You cannot fork ArtCraft and remove ArtCraft community, donation links, or paid model services. We intend to 
>    make money to improve ArtCraft for everyone.
> 
> 4. You cannot use the ArtCraft name, logo, or mascot characters to promote your business without permission.

This license means you can see what we're doing and not be at risk of having the rug pulled out from under 
you (eg. if our founders die or our business collapses). It also gives you a really great way to customize the 
software or lend a hand in reporting (or even fixing) bugs.

Our desire is to support artists, designers, and filmmakers. We want to help you build your own creative studios
and businesses. We want to give you creative software you can use forever.

ArtCraft is free. We do offer models available through us where you can pay us and support our development, but we also 
offer the ability for you to use other providers - and we'll keep adding more options so you have maximum flexibility.

## Our Promise

- All development and business plans will be communicated openly with the community.

- Except for minor test scripts or a few small places where we might need to use licensed 3rd party code, all of 
  our engineering efforts will live in a single publicly available monorepo. You can see everything we do and even 
  benefit from using it for personal use. We plan on building a lot more than what you see today, and you'll get 
  all of it.

- We will not "rug pull" our users. If our business shuts down, gets acquired, or otherwise changes, the tools 
  we create will always continue to function in the same way.

- If the business ends and our founders quit working in this space, we'll make it so the software transitions 
  to an OSI-approved open source license. (We don't intend to quit!)

## Why not OSI Open Source?

Philosophical answer: The OSI is an industry body led by hyperscalers. They poach from open source all the time, yet 
hyperscaler systems and code (AWS, GCP, YouTube, etc.) remain closed source. The tiniest nuggets are open, but the vast 
machinery surrounding it - systems, user behaviors, funnels, at-scale moneymakers - is totally closed.

Practical answer: OSI licenses make it exceptionally challenging to grow big things commercially. And many of 
the licenses leave room for hyperscalers to reach in and cherrypick pieces for themselves that they can better 
commercialize than the original authors.

Then there's completely open source software that doesn't even attempt to be a business. 

We love software like Blender, but (1) we want/need jobs, (2) we want to build something at scale, and (3) this will 
eventually become much more capital intensive than just writing code. We one day want to train novel models that work 
directly in conjunction with the user interface. 

If and when we do get to scale, we intend to keep every bit of our work in the open. Available for use, inspection, 
learning, fitting onto consumer GPU hardware, and more. 

Not having a way to make money is unfortunately what killed Stability.ai. Stability.ai walked so that others could 
eventually run. (Black Forest Labs, et al.) We're not egotistical enough to count ourselves in that party yet, but we 
believe in the original Stability.ai ethos and that their model can work with a few tweaks.

We want to build big and incredible tools the world hasn't seen before. We want to keep them free and entirely source 
available. You don't have to pay us, but if you do, all of your investment goes right back into the engineering 
and the tools. We're writing code you can clone and keep.

## Inspiration

We took inspiration for this from [Fair Source](https://fair.io/), [Fair Code](https://faircode.io/), 
the [Defold License](https://defold.com/license/), and Hacker News discussions. The folks at Obsidian 
have some pretty good thoughts on this as well.
