## Why Control Faces?

Imagine you're creating a video with a main character. Wouldn't it be cool if you could make that character look exactly how you want? With Storyteller.ai, you can! You can even use a picture as a guide.

## How it Works

Here's the secret sauce:
- Reference Images: Find a picture of the face you want. It could be a photo of a person, a drawing, or even a cartoon character
- Upload it to Storyteller.ai
- Prompts: Tell Storyteller.ai what you want the face to look like. Be specific! For example, "a young woman with brown hair and blue eyes"
- AI Magic: Storyteller.ai uses your reference image and your prompts to create the perfect face for your character

## Let's Try It!

1. Find a Reference Image: Pick a picture of the face you want to use
2. Upload the Image: Go to Storyteller.ai and upload your picture
3. Crop the Image: Make sure the picture only shows the face
4. Write Your Prompts: Describe the face in detail. Include things like hair color, eye color, and any other features you want
5. Generate Your Video: Storyteller.ai will create a video with your character's new face

## Tips for Awesome Faces

- Clear Images: Use a clear picture of the face you want. Blurry pictures won't work as well
- Detailed Prompts: The more details you give Storyteller.ai, the better the results
- Experiment: Try different reference images and prompts to see what works best
