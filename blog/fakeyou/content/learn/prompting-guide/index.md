# General Prompting Guide
Try to be as in-depth as possible. For subjects, be sure to describe details such as hair color, eye color, hair length, clothing and its style, age, and any other distinguishing features (e.g., freckles, glasses, wrinkles). Even for famous subjects, please be as descriptive as you can.

Here's an example prompt:
>A blonde-haired woman with green eyes and shoulder-length hair is walking on the shore of a beach. She's wearing a blue cardigan, a white dress and black heels. As she walks, the light from the dimming sunset illuminates her and the orange sky. There are footprints in the sand where she was walking. The sea is calm with waves crashing on the shore and dissipating into foam.

or for a "tag" related style:
>1girl, solo, medium hair, green eyes, blonde hair, black footwear, high heels, walking, outdoors, beach, ocean, waves, sea foam, sunset, orange sky, sun, cloud, footprints"


## Prompting on Anime Models:
Styles such as Anime Flat, Bloom Lighting, Fantasy 2.5d, Anime Standard, Ghibli, Ink Splash, Anime Retro Neon, Anime Pastel Cute, Creepy, Dragonball and Anime Cyberpunk follow a "tag" format for prompting. These tags can be found on “-booru” websites such as safebooru or danbooru. If you’re not sure what to prompt for or what the tags would be, try searching them on a website such as those or looking at their tag databases. 

Let’s take an example prompt using natural language formatting.
> a woman with blue eyes and long brown hair wearing a white fluffy fur coat waving her hands as she talks in front of a store

Here’s how we can change it to work with anime models:
> 1girl, solo, blue eyes, brown hair, long hair, fur-trimmed jacket, white jacket, waving, open mouth, talking, outdoors, shop, building, display, glass

Here are some more examples:
> 1girl, solo, hu tao, brown hair, red eyes, long hair, very long hair, twintails, hair flower, hat, jacket, long sleeves, outdoors, sky, palm tree, beach, sunlight, lens flare

> raiden shogun, 1girl, solo, purple hair, purple eyes, blunt bangs, single braid, long hair, bridal gauntlets, obi, mole, mole under eye, hair ornament, japanese clothes, kimono, petals, cherry blossoms, outdoors, standing

Prompting on General Models:
> Most of our styles follow a “natural language” format. This means that describing it as you would to another person would work best - make sure to make it as detailed as you can to ensure that what you’re looking for will show in the generation. 

Here’s an example prompt:
> A bustling market in a vibrant medieval village, filled with colorful stalls and lively merchants. The scene is set under a clear blue sky with the warm afternoon sun casting long shadows. In the foreground, a young woman in a flowing, green dress with intricate embroidery is examining a basket of fresh, ripe fruits at a wooden stall.

Here’s an example for if you wanted to describe a famous celebrity such as Ryan Gosling:
> Ryan Gosling leaning casually against a sleek, futuristic car in a neon-lit cyberpunk cityscape. He has short, slightly tousled blond hair and piercing blue eyes that reflect the vibrant colors of the city around him. His expression is cool and composed, with a hint of mystery. He is dressed in a stylish, dark trench coat with high-tech accessories, blending classic and futuristic fashion. The car is a glossy black, with sharp, angular lines and glowing blue accents.

Here are some examples of what you can add to change the focus of subjects:
> while looking directly at the camera

>looking at viewer

>while looking away to the side
