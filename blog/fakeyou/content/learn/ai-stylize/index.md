# AI Stylize
In the AI Stylize panel, you can select your desired style, input your prompt, and adjust optional settings like style reference and style strength. You'll also find toggles for Sync Lips, Face Detailer, Upscale, Use Cinematic, and Engine PreProcessing. Let's go over what each of these options does.

## Style
Style refers to the art style or form that the AI-generated output will adopt.

## Prompt
The prompt field is where you describe what you'd like to see. Entering a prompt guides the AI to generate your desired content—the more detailed, the better.

## Style Reference
Style reference allows you to influence the AI output by providing an image as reference. 

## Style Strength
This is how much the AI will influence the final video. A lower style strength will help if you’re experiencing issues with consistency or too much of a “dreamy” look. Try going for a style strength of 0.6 and working your way up from there. 

## Sync Lips
If toggled on, this will sync the character’s lips to the audio you provide. 

## Face Detailer
Enabling this adds extra detail to the face to keep it from looking muddy or distorted. 

## Upscale
Upscale enhances your video's resolution, adding clarity and coherence.

## Use Cinematic
Toggling this enables a slower workflow with a higher base resolution that automatically upscales, resulting in higher-quality output.

## Engine PreProcessing
This toggle allows for the most accurate preprocessing by the engine, improving the final output quality at the cost of rendering speed. Avoid using this when working with Image or Video Planes.
