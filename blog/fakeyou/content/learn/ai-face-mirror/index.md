[AI Face Mirror](https://fakeyou.com/ai-face-mirror) is a tool used to transfer facial expressions, audio, and vocal lip movement from one face video to an image. This feature is ideal for creating realistic animations by mapping the motion from a “driver” video onto a target face.

3. **Generate the Animation:** Click on the create button to begin the animation process, the AI video will process the motion transfer and generate the final video. Queue priority and video length will depend on the status of your FakeYou membership.

## Recommendations and Use Cases

It is recommended to select videos or images with clear target faces, this will allow for a cleaner transfer and animation quality suitable to your preferences.

You can use the driver videos for content such as:
- Content creations for videos, podcasts, and other media to enhance them.
- Entertainment to create fun videos or engaging with character voices.
- Create educational material or make engaging content through the use of AI faces.
