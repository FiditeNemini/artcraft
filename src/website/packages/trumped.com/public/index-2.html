          <strong>Update June 4, 2020:</strong> There's a new model.
        </p>
        <p>
          I replaced the old model with a completely new one that doesn't crash and is a 
          10x speed up over the last one. While it doesn't currently sound as good as the 
          old model, the performance improvements were good enough to warrant using it 
          immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're unhappy with how the results sound, try changing the words a litle.
          Experiment. If words aren't working, that's because I trained the network on 
          phonemes instead of raw text. Try sounding out your request: "pikachu is a 
          pokemon" can be written as "peek ah choo is a poke ay mon". Try adding commas
          or periods. I'll fix this issue as soon as I can.

        <h2>Terms and Conditions.</h2>

        <strong>Don't use this website for mischief.</strong>

        <p>Please have fun with this app amongst your friends and colleages, but don't
        do anything stupid. The actions you take are your own, and I am not responsible
        for any trouble you might get into<sup>&dagger;</sup>. Use your best judgment.
        For example, though you might find it funny, please don't use this app to harass
        the poor people working at Gamestop. They don't have Battle Toads.</p>

        <strong>Artistic intent.</strong>

        <p>This website is a form of artistic expression, parody, and engineering creativity.
        It is not meant to be harmful to anyone in any way. The audio generated is sufficiently
        poor in quality and should not be confused with actual speech. Everyone should be
        able to have a good laugh.</p>

        <strong>Deep fakes are good.</strong>

        <p>So-called <em>deep fakes</em> are not much different for us today than Photoshop
        was for new users of the World Wide Web back in the 90s. It's impressive new technology
        that defies our expectations. Instead of just pictures, machine learning can generate
        complex shapes in all sorts of signal domains. It's really impressive stuff.</p>

        <p>If you restrict the technology out of fear, it becomes the tool of state actors.
        If it's left wide open, it's just a toy. Society will learn to accept and enjoy it just
        as we did with Photoshop.</p>

        <p>Our brains are already capable of reading passages in other people's voices and
        picturing vivid scenes without them ever existing. Deep models give computers the
        ability to do the same thing. That's powerful. This and related advances in computer
        vision will unlock a higher order of creativity than was ever before possible.</p>

        <p><em>Don't legislate deep fakes.</em></p>

        <strong>What's next?</strong>

        <p>I'll be improving trumped.com, adding more voices, and scaling the app.
        I've got some new models baking in the GPU ovens right now.</p>

        <p>I'm very busy between work and my startup, so please give me time.</p>

        <p><sup>&dagger;</sup> Anyone can download Tacotron from Github to produce the same
        results on their own. Trumped.com is not connected with your activities.</p>
