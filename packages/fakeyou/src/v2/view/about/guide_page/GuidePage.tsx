            <p>
              Here are some quick tips to generate the best sounding text-to-speech.
            </p>
            <div>
              <h2 className="mb-4">Fixing nonsense &ldquo;babbling&rdquo;</h2>
              <p>
                (This is not a typical problem.)
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Some of our very earliest models were built using a limited amount of data 
                and are sometimes prone to producing speech that sounds like &ldquo;babbling&rdquo;
                or incoherent vocal convulsions. 
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                This problem can typically be fixed by 
                {" "}
                <strong><em>adding ending punctuation to your sentence</em></strong>. 
                If the audio still has problems, 
                {" "}
                <strong><em>add a comma at the start and end of your text</em></strong>
                {" "}
                so that the program can add brief pauses. This usually corrects the problem.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                If the incoherent audio is at the end, you can always edit it with software 
                such as Audacity.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2 className="mb-4">
                Getting the correct pronunciation
              </h2>
              <p>
                Sometimes a TTS model will not pronounce words correctly or in the 
                way you like.
                You can <strong><em>experiment with misspellings</em></strong> of words until you get something 
                that sounds better. For example <em>&ldquo;peekahchuu&rdquo;</em> might sound different 
                than <em>&ldquo;pikachu&rdquo;</em>.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Many of our models also support Arpabet phonetic annotation. It's an advanced feature you can 
                learn to use by joining our <DiscordLink2 />.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2 className="mb-4">Emotional conditioning</h2>
              <p>
                To get a certain emotion and personality in the message you
                want, add some extra emotional &ldquo;conditioning&rdquo;. 
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                To do this, think of a strong emotional sentence or two you could start with. 
                Then add this to the very beginning of your text.
                For example, to add some anger to <em>&ldquo;I can't believe you said that to me!&rdquo;</em>, 
                you could input the following instead:
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                <em>&ldquo;<strong>Darn it! I hate you!</strong> I can't believe you said that to me!&rdquo;</em>
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                You can later remove these extra leading sentences with an audio editor such as Audacity, leaving 
                just the speech you want.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2 className="mb-4">Yelling emotions</h2>
              <p>
                While not all models support it, some of our models incorporate rich emotional samples 
                that were transcripted with an emphasis mark &ndash; typically an exclamation mark (!).
